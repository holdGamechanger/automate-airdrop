# Architecture Overview

## Overview

The **Crypto Airdrop Automation on Solana** project is designed to simulate an automated process for distributing SPL tokens via the Solana blockchain. The project is divided into several components for modularity and ease of testing.

## Components

- **Configuration (`config.py`):**  
  Stores all the parameters necessary for the airdrop (RPC URL, token mint address, wallet keys, etc.).

- **Blockchain Connection:**  
  Uses [solana-py](https://github.com/michaelhly/solana-py) to establish a connection with the Solana network.  
  The `connect_to_solana` function in `airdrop.py` handles this.

- **Token Transfer Instruction:**  
  The token transfer is built using the SPL Token Program's `transfer` instruction from `spl.token.instructions`.  
  The sender's and recipient's associated token accounts are used to simulate the token transfer.

- **Airdrop Simulation:**  
  The main function `simulate_airdrop` iterates through a list of recipient addresses and simulates the airdrop process by building and signing transactions.  
  Currently, transactions are not broadcast to the network for safety.

## Future Improvements

- **Security Enhancements:**  
  Incorporate secure management of private keys (e.g., using environment variables or a secrets manager).

- **Transaction Management:**  
  Implement a queue system for handling large-scale airdrops and retry mechanisms for failed transactions.

- **User Interface:**  
  Create a web-based dashboard to monitor airdrop status in real time.

- **Testing:**  
  Develop unit and integration tests to ensure the robustness of the code.
